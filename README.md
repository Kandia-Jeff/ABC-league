This is a program developed by Jeff Kandia,Obiero Samuel,Lovine Mwema and Theuri Robert 
This  program imports:teams,local town of the teams and the teams' stadium 
It generates fixtures using the imported teams and creates two legs where each team faces each other 
It displays the generated fixtures to the consule for viewing
Lastly it can save the generated fixtures to a csv file which includes the information like : the weekend the teams play,the leg the teams are playing in and the stadium where the teams are playing
